# Advent of Code 2022

It's this time of the year again!!! Advent of Code 2022!! :smiley:
This year I feel stronger and way more confident with my coding skills, but at the same time I'm busy with work so my only challenge will be to try and complete every puzzle the day it's been released. Below there is a table which will keep a track on whether I managed it this year or not! 1 star for part 1 only, 2 stars for both parts completed on the day! Happy Christmas!!!
